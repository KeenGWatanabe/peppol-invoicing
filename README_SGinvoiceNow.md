Certainly! While Google Sheets itself isn't a direct Peppol Access Point, you can use it as part of your workflow to participate in Singapore's **InvoiceNow** (Peppol) network by integrating it with a Peppol-certified solution. Here's a simple example:

---

### **Example Workflow: Google Sheets → Peppol Access Point → InvoiceNow**
1. **Set Up Your Google Sheet**  
   - Create a sheet with invoice data (e.g., `Supplier Name`, `Buyer UEN`, `Invoice Number`, `Amount`, etc.).
   - Example row:  
     | Buyer UEN | Invoice No. | Amount (SGD) | Description |
     |-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
     | 123456789X | INV-2023-001 | 100.00 | Web Design Services |

2. **Connect to a Peppol Access Point**  
   - Use an **automation tool** (like **Zapier**, **Make (Integromat)**, or **Google Apps Script**) to send data from your sheet to a Peppol Access Point provider (e.g., **Storecove**, **TrueCommerce**, **Tradeshift**).  
   - Many Access Points offer APIs or email-based submission options.

3. **Convert Data to Peppol Format**  
   - The Access Point will transform your sheet data into a **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0** format (the standard for InvoiceNow).  
   - Example snippet of the resulting XML (simplified):
     ```xml
     <Invoice>
       <BuyerReference>123456789X</BuyerReference> <!-- Buyer's UEN -->
       <InvoiceNumber>INV-2023-001</InvoiceNumber>
       <Amount>100.00</Amount>
       <Currency>SGD</Currency>
     </Invoice>
     ```

4. **Send via Peppol Network**  
   - The Access Point routes the invoice to the recipient’s Peppol ID (e.g., the buyer’s registered InvoiceNow ID).  
   - The buyer receives it in their accounting system (e.g., **Xero**, **QuickBooks**, or their ERP).

### **Key Requirements for Singapore (InvoiceNow)**
- **Peppol ID**: Your business and your buyer must have Peppol IDs (e.g., your UEN + `:inv` for InvoiceNow).  
- **Access Point Provider**: Choose one certified for Peppol (e.g., [IMDA’s list](https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-and-licensing-listing/invoicenow-for-businesses)).  
- **Data Validation**: Ensure your sheet includes mandatory fields like UEN, GST details (if applicable), and invoice numbering.

---

### **Simple Tools to Bridge Google Sheets & Peppol**
- **Zapier/Make**: Automate sending sheet data to an Access Point’s API.  
- **Google Apps Script**: Write a script to email invoices (in PEPPOL format) to an Access Point’s submission address.  
- **Low-Code Platforms**: Some providers offer Google Sheets plugins or CSV uploads.
